# TIY Academy Layout

This is a two-day assignment. Your mission is to build this page:

http://academy.smashingboxes.com/

## Normal mode

Don't worry about the animations, hover effects, forms, etc.

But *do* work on making it responsive.

### Focus on MVP

- What could you ship and still have a useful site?
- Implement the most important bit first
- Check it in/ship it
- Implement the next most important bit
- Check it in/ship it
- etc

### Follow an implementation strategy

Here's a suggestion

- First, grab resources (images)
- Drop in a [CSS reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
- Implement the big, block layout
- Implement your basic defaults: colors, fonts, h1, p, a styles, etc
- Implement the page header details
- Implement the page "hero" block details
- Ship that
- Implement the next section
- Ship that
- ...

## Hard mode

- Get animations working
- Get hover effects working
- 3-levels of responsive design
