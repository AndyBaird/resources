# Cohort 4

This is the repo where all of our class-notes, lesson plans, curriculum,
prework... Basically where all things cohort 4 will go!

If you're wondering where to start, first [do the prework](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/prework.md).

Next, you might want to flip through [the resources](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/resources.md).
