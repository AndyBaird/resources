## Set up your Mac

1. [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. [Install Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
4. [Install Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
5. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
6. [Install Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower)

## Learn the front-end languages

1. [Learn HTML basics](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
2. [Learn CSS basics](http://www.w3schools.com/css/)
3. [Learn JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

That 3rd link is to a book. Try to get through the first 5-6 chapters before
the cohort starts. The more you know beforehand, the better you'll fare in the
first few weeks of school!

If you want to play with HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, you may want to use one of
these handy tools:

## Terminal

You're working on a Mac. When developing on Mac or Linux, you'll be using
the terminal extensively. The more you know about it before starting the course,
the happier you'll be. *Believe me!*

1. [Read up on the terminal](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics)

## Git

Git is a version control system.

It allows you to track changes you've made to files in your projects. If you
make a massive change to a file, save it, and then regret it, you can use git
to recover a previous (working) version of your file(s). Git also makes
collaborating with teammates *much* easier. You and your teammates can change
files in your project without worrying (too much) about stepping on each others'
toes.

We'll be using Git extensively, so you should read up on it.
