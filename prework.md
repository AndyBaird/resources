# Cohort 4, Front-End Prework

The following is the prework for the front end class. The more you do, the more
you'll get out of the cohort. Students who skip prework often find themselves
playing catchup throughout the cohort, so don't do that!

Go through this prework and turn in the [prework survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d0O5frSJy7L-e6bdz5y3ZDmcSj8u-GK0x_UkaqsMqfs/viewform?usp=send_form)
by *April 29th*. Then, make sure you get a nice, restful, long weekend before
the class begins! We look forward to seeing you all in May!

## Set up your Mac

1. [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. [Install Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
4. [Install Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
5. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
6. [Install Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower)
7. [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Learn the front-end languages

Come up with a schedule for yourself-- maybe 30 minutes/an hour per day-- to
spend reading about and exploring the following subjects.

### HTML and CSS

- [Learn HTML and CSS basics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).
- [Play with HTML/CSS in Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

### JavaScript

Learn JavaScript by going through the
[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) book. I would suggest
the first 3-5 chapters. Anything beyond that is *great* but not necessary for
prework.

### Terminal

You will be using the Terminal. A *lot*. So, do yourself a favor and learn
about it before the cohort starts!

- [Read this](http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/)
- [Take this course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations) note,
Team Treehouse is not free, but it does have a 14 day free trial, so take
advantage of that!
- [And read this](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li...).

### Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system. It allows you to make changes to files, track
file history, coordinate your changes with those being made by your teammates,
etc. We'll be using this heavily, so the more you know, the better!

### More reading/resources

You can read a whole lot more about HTML over at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories).
That link brings you to a comprehensive list of HTML elements, grouped by
category.

If you want to play with HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, you may want to use one of
these handy tools:
