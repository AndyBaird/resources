# Solving problems

A *massive* part of programming is solving problems you've never encountered.
This is a skill we try to instill in you by the time the cohort is done. Here
are some tried and true guidelines to that end.

## How to ask a question

Before asking a question on a forum (or to your boss)...

- Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
- Try to find an answer by reading the manual/docs.
- Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
- Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
- Try to find an answer by reading the source code.

## My program doesn't work

When you've written some code and it's "just not working", here's what to do...

- Look for error messages in your browser console
- Look for error messages in your terminal
- 90% of errors are syntactic errors. Check your syntax
- Double check your syntax
  - Are you calling a function as if it is a field?
  - Are you calling a field as if it is a method?
  - Did you forget a semicolon?
  - Did you forget curly brackets?
  - Are you treating one type (e.g. a string) as if it is another (e.g. an array)?
- If you're confident it's not a syntax error, look the error up on Google
- Check and double check your logic
  - Sometimes, it helps to write your problem down as bullet points
  - Then, walk through your code, in sequence, and make sure it aligns with your bullets
- Debug your code
  - Put breakpoints above, in, and below the code in question
  - Run the code and step through it until it breaks
- Get a second set of eyes on the problem
  - Pull in a classmate/teammate and have them look things over
  - Pull in an instructor and see what they do
